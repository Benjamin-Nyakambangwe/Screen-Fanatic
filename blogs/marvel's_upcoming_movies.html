        <h4>Jessica Jones - April 2019</h4>
        <p>Jessica Jones will return to Netflix for Season 3, in a batch of episodes may be the hero's final outing on the platform. This is due to Netflix's cancellation of Iron Fist, Luke Cage, and Daredevil. Jessica Jones was part of the same original 4-show agreement between Marvel and Netflix, so their cancellations do not bode well for Jess. What's worse is that there's a two-year hold on Marvel using her after a Netflix cancellation, meaning this could be Jessica's last television adventure, at least for a while.
        </p>
        <p>If there is a silver lining, it's that the Jessica Jones team has had enough of a heads up that it could wrap the series with a conclusive ending if Netflix doesn't intend to revisit Jessica in the future. If nothing else, hopefully the season resolves the beef between Jessica and Trish, and goes further into Trish's transformation into Hellcat. Also, one last appearance from David Tennant as Kilgrav</p>

        <h4>Cloak & Dagger - Spring 2019</h4>
        <p>Freeform's Marvel series is coming back for Season 2, as one of the lesser celebrated superhero shows of 2018 is hoping to make a splash in 2019. Some promising twists and turns in the first season and less Marvel competition may allow Cloak & Dagger to do just that in Season 2. The Season 1 finale laid the groundwork for both Tandy and Tyrone's stories to develop quite a bit in the coming year.</p>
        <p>As for what to expect in the upcoming season, Cloak & Dagger teased the emergence of the villain Mayhem, which could certainly be a problem for Tyrone and Tandy as they continue to work out their powers. It's also been teased Tyrone will learn to send people into his cloak, and that some of the mystique behind that will be examined as well</p>
        
        <h4>Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. - July 2019</h4>
        <p>Marvel's Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. ended Season 5 with a pretty wild twist, but it looks likes Season 6 may be even crazier. Phil Coulson was believed to be dead, so why is he puttering around with possible amnesia in the latest trailer? Is that even the same version of Phil? How will the rest of the team react to this information?</p>
        <p>We can't be sure, but there's a good chance that whatever is going on with Coulson could tie in with the Marvel films that precede it. Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. will premiere after Captain Marvel and Avengers: Endgame, Perhaps Coulson really is dead, and this new guy is just a Skrull in disguise? Maybe he's a clone, or an evil variant of Coulson from another dimension? The possibilities are truly endless.</p>

        <h4>Loki - ???</h4>
        <p>t's the show announcement that's started a flurry of speculation ahead of Avengers: Endgame. If Loki really died in Avengers: Infinity War, why did Disney announce he's getting a series on Disney+? It didn't make sense, unless of course, it's a prequel series and we're seeing an adventure for what's going on with the God of Mischief prior to the present MCU timeline? Maybe, or it could be a tale that follows a reincarnated Loki.</p>
        <p>Either scenario is possible, and there's even a chance this upcoming Loki adventure won't feature Tom Hiddleston. Reports have alleged another younger actor will portray the character, with Hiddleston playing the character part of the time, or narrating the adventure. One would imagine more answers on the series will roll out after Avengers: Endgame, so interested parties only need to wait a couple more months</p>

        <h4>Big Hero 6: The Series - ???</h4>
        <p>Big Hero 6: The Series was given a Season 2 renewal quite a while back, but when it will return is still up in the air. The last episode of Season 1 concluded back in October, which was quite a stretch for a 20-episode season that began in November 2017. Plus, animated shows tend to have a different timetable than live-action in general, so there's no guarantee the new season arrives before the end of 2019.</p>
        <p>With that said, the early renewal might ensure that there isn't a considerable delay between seasons, as the staff had the go ahead to get started ahead of the Season 1 premiere. That means the kids (and adults) who love Baymax so much may not have too long of a wait before he's back on television, but we can only speculate. In the meantime, we can all only wait and wonder what's next for Hiro and the gang.</p>

        <h4>Legion - June 2019</h4>
        <p>Marvel's trippiest superhero show was greenlit for Season 3, and the world will get one final wild season of Legion. Those who watched Season 2 will confirm that's a very good thing, as the Shadow King went free in order to help the good guys take on a greater threat: David. Obviously, David was rattled by the betrayal of Syd and the rest of colleagues, and split the scene in a quick burst before anyone could stop him.</p>
        <p>As for what's next, that's anyone's guess. Accurately guessing what's coming in Legion is just about impossible. With this being the final season, it wouldn't be surprising to learn Noah Hawley's taking the time to get it right. The show's earned high praise from critics and viewers for its first two seasons, so anything under par would be a disappointment</p>
